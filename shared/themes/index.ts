// Mar 17, 2024: I tried to use 'parcel' to do SCSS rendering at build time (using the new macro functionality), but it requires newer typescript and also Parcel kinda messes with pnpm for whatever reason. I also considered using esbuild to embed SCSS file contents, but esbuild does not typecheck out of the box. In the end, reading files at runtime is the easiest solution.

function readStylesFile(filePath: string) {
  const root = basename(__dirname) === 'dist' ? resolve(__dirname, '..') : __dirname
  const path = resolve(root, filePath)
  const scss = renderScss(fs.readFileSync(path, 'utf8'))
  if (!scss) throw new Error(`Failed to render SCSS file ${path}`)
  return scss
}
